Postman is a popular tool for API development. It allows you to send requests to your API and view the responses without writing any code.

## Setting Up

If you haven't already, download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## Creating a Collection

A **Collection** is a group of saved requests. It helps keep your workspace organized.

<Steps>

1.  Open Postman.
2.  Click **Collections** in the sidebar.
3.  Click the **+** (Plus) icon to create a new collection.
4.  Name it **"Task Manager API"**.

</Steps>

## Creating Requests

Let's add a request to fetch all tasks.

<Steps>

1.  Right-click your new collection and select **Add Request**.
2.  Name the request **"Get All Tasks"**.
3.  Set the method to **GET**.
4.  Enter the URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/tasks`.
5.  Click **Save**.
6.  Click **Send** (make sure your Hono server is running!).

</Steps>

You should see the JSON response with your mock tasks in the bottom pane.

## Using Environments

Environments allow you to use variables. This is useful for switching between Local (`localhost`) and Production URLs.

### Creating an Environment

1.  Click **Environments** in the sidebar.
2.  Click **+** to create a new environment.
3.  Name it **"Local Development"**.
4.  Add a variable:
    - **Variable**: `baseUrl`
    - **Initial Value**: `http://localhost:3000`
    - **Current Value**: `http://localhost:3000`
5.  Click **Save**.

### Using the Variable

1.  Select **"Local Development"** from the environment dropdown at the top right.
2.  Go back to your request.
3.  Change the URL to `{{baseUrl}}/api/tasks`.
4.  Hover over `{{baseUrl}}` to see it resolve to your localhost URL.
5.  Send the request again to verify it works.

## Saving Examples

Postman allows you to save the response as an example. This is great for documentation.

1.  After a successful request, click **Save Response** -> **Save as Example**.

In the next section, you will put all of this into practice!
