Welcome to Module 3! In this module, we shift our focus to the server-side. We will be building the backend for our Task Manager application using **Hono.js**.

## What You Will Learn

In this module, we will cover:

- **Routing Fundamentals**: Handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and route parameters.
- **Middleware**: Intercepting requests for logging, authentication, and error handling.
- **Mocking APIs**: Creating placeholder endpoints to unblock frontend development.
- **API Testing**: Using Postman to test and verify your API endpoints.

## The Role of the Backend

The backend is the brain of our application. It handles:

1.  **Data Persistence**: Storing and retrieving tasks from the database (we'll mock this first).
2.  **Business Logic**: Validating data and enforcing rules (e.g., "a task must have a title").
3.  **Security**: Ensuring only authorized users can access their data.

## Our Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Hono.js (Fast, lightweight, web-standard based)
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (Serverless)
- **Testing Tool**: Postman

Let's get started by exploring how Hono handles routing!
