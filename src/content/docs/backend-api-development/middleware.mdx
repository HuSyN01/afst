Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`c.req`), the response object (via `c`), and the `next` function. They can execute code, modify the request/response, and end the request-response cycle.

## Why Use Middleware?

Common use cases include:

- **Logging**: Record details about every incoming request.
- **Authentication**: Verify if a user is logged in before allowing access.
- **Error Handling**: Catch errors globally.
- **Timing**: Measure how long a request takes to process.

## Built-in Middleware

Hono comes with many built-in middleware. Let's look at the Logger middleware.

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { logger } from "hono/logger";

const app = new Hono();

// Use the logger middleware for all routes
app.use("*", logger());

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Check your console logs!"));

export default app;
```

When you visit `/`, you will see a log in your terminal like:
`GET / 200 2ms`

## Custom Middleware

Creating your own middleware is straightforward.

```typescript
app.use("*", async (c, next) => {
  console.log(
    `[${new Date().toISOString()}] Incoming request: ${c.req.method} ${
      c.req.path
    }`
  );

  await next(); // Pass control to the next handler

  console.log("Response sent!");
});
```

### The `next()` Function

The `next()` function is crucial. It calls the next middleware or route handler in the stack.

- Code **before** `await next()` runs before the route handler.
- Code **after** `await next()` runs after the route handler has finished.

## Execution Order

Middleware executes in the order it is defined.

```typescript
app.use(middleware1);
app.use(middleware2);
app.get("/", handler);
```

Flow: `middleware1` (start) -> `middleware2` (start) -> `handler` -> `middleware2` (end) -> `middleware1` (end).

In our Task Manager, we will use middleware for authentication (later) and logging.
