Routing is the mechanism by which requests are directed to the code that handles them. In Hono.js, routing is intuitive and follows standard HTTP patterns.

## Basic Routing

Hono provides methods for all standard HTTP verbs: `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`.

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

// GET request to the root
app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello Hono!"));

// POST request to create a resource
app.post("/tasks", (c) => c.json({ message: "Task created" }));

// DELETE request to remove a resource
app.delete("/tasks", (c) => c.json({ message: "Task deleted" }));

export default app;
```

## Route Parameters

Route parameters are named segments of the URL, specified by a colon `:`. They are used to capture values at specific positions in the URL.

### Getting a Single Parameter

```typescript
app.get("/tasks/:id", (c) => {
  const id = c.req.param("id");
  return c.text(`Fetching task with ID: ${id}`);
});
```

If you visit `/tasks/123`, the response will be `Fetching task with ID: 123`.

## Query Parameters

Query parameters are key-value pairs at the end of a URL (e.g., `/search?q=hono`).

```typescript
app.get("/search", (c) => {
  const query = c.req.query("q");
  return c.text(`Searching for: ${query}`);
});
```

## JSON Responses

In modern API development, we almost always communicate using JSON. Hono makes this easy with `c.json()`.

```typescript
app.get("/api/status", (c) => {
  return c.json({
    status: "ok",
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    timestamp: new Date(),
  });
});
```

## Grouping Routes

As your application grows, you might want to group related routes. Hono supports this via chaining or sub-apps, but for now, we'll keep it simple.

In the next section, we'll look at how to add functionality that runs _before_ your route handlers using Middleware.
