React is a library for building user interfaces. It lets you build UI components that are declarative, efficient, and flexible.

## JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It looks like HTML, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

```tsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

In our Task Manager project, we use JSX to define the structure of our components.

## Components

Components are the building blocks of any React application. They let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.

### Functional Components

We use modern Functional Components with TypeScript.

```tsx
function Welcome(props: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

## State and React Hooks

Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

### `useState`

`useState` is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### `useEffect`

`useEffect` lets you perform side effects in function components (like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM).

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

function PageTitle() {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = "Task Manager";
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs once on mount

  return <div>Check the tab title!</div>;
}
```

## Custom Hooks

In our Task Manager (`tm`) project, we often extract logic into custom hooks. For example, `useTasksQuery` encapsulates the logic for fetching tasks.

```ts
// Example concept from our project
export const useTasksQuery = () => {
  // ... logic to fetch tasks
};
```

This keeps our components clean and focused on the UI.
