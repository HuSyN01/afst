Welcome to Module 2! In this module, we will dive into Frontend Development using React and TanStack Router.

## Task Manager

We will be building the frontend for our Task Manager application. We'll use **Vite** for a fast development environment and **React** as our UI library.

### Scaffolding the Project

We will create a new React project using Vite.

<Steps>

1.  Open your terminal and navigate to your projects folder.

2.  Run the create command:

    ```bash
    bun create vite task-manager --template react-ts
    ```

3.  Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd task-manager
    ```

4.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

5.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

</Steps>

You should now see your React app running at `http://localhost:5173`!

## Project Structure

Here is a quick look at the structure of the project we just created:

<FileTree>

- src
  - assets/
  - **App.tsx** The main component
  - **main.tsx** The entry point
  - index.css
  - vite-env.d.ts
- index.html
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- vite.config.ts

</FileTree>

In the next section, we will explore the fundamentals of React.
