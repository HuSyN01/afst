import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

For our Task Manager application, we are using **TanStack Router**. It is a powerful, type-safe router for React applications.

## Why TanStack Router?

### 1. Type-Safety 🛡️

TanStack Router provides 100% type safety. This means TypeScript will catch errors if you try to navigate to a route that doesn't exist or forget a required parameter.

### 2. Search Param Handling 🔍

It treats search parameters (URL query strings) as first-class citizens. They are validated, typed, and managed just like other state.

### 3. Built for Modern React

It supports features like data loading, caching, and pending states out of the box.

## How to Install TanStack Router

To get started with TanStack Router, install the necessary packages in your project:

```bash
bun add @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-router-devtools
bun add -D @tanstack/router-plugin
```

- `@tanstack/react-router`: The core router library for React
- `@tanstack/react-router-devtools`: Development tools for debugging routes
- `@tanstack/router-plugin`: Vite plugin for automatic route generation

In our Task Manager project, these packages are already installed, but you'll need to run these commands when starting a new project.

## Core Concepts

### Creating a Router

The router is the core of the application's navigation. In our `tm` project, this is set up in `src/react-app/main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { RouterProvider, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

// Register the router instance for type safety
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}
```

### Route Definitions & File-Based Routing

We use file-based routing. The file structure in `src/routes` determines the URL paths.

- `routes/index.tsx` -> `/`
- `routes/about.tsx` -> `/about`
- `routes/tasks/$taskId.tsx` -> `/tasks/123`

#### Creating Your First Route: An About Page

To create a new route, follow these steps:

1. Go to the `src/routes` folder in your project.

2. Create a new file called `about.tsx`.

3. Add this code to the file:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/about')({
  component: About,
})

function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Our App</h1>
      <p>This is a fun task manager app made with love!</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This defines a route for the `/about` URL that renders the `About` component. The `createFileRoute('/about')` connects the file name to the route path.

### Layouts

Layouts allow us to share UI (like a sidebar or header) across multiple routes.

In our project, we use:

- `_auth.tsx`: Layout for login/signup pages (no sidebar).
- `_protected.tsx`: Layout for the dashboard (includes Sidebar, Header).

The `_` prefix creates a **pathless layout route**, meaning it wraps child routes without adding a segment to the URL.

### Route Tree Generation

TanStack Router automatically generates a `routeTree.gen.ts` file based on your file structure. You don't need to manually maintain a list of routes!

```ts
// routeTree.gen.ts (Auto-generated)
import { Route as rootRoute } from "./routes/__root";
import { Route as IndexImport } from "./routes/index";
// ...
```

In the next section, we will put this into practice with an exercise.
