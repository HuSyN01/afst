For our Task Manager application, we are using **TanStack Router**. It is a powerful, type-safe router for React applications.

## Why TanStack Router?

### 1. Type-Safety 🛡️

TanStack Router provides 100% type safety. This means TypeScript will catch errors if you try to navigate to a route that doesn't exist or forget a required parameter.

### 2. Search Param Handling 🔍

It treats search parameters (URL query strings) as first-class citizens. They are validated, typed, and managed just like other state.

### 3. Built for Modern React

It supports features like data loading, caching, and pending states out of the box.

## Core Concepts

### Creating a Router

The router is the core of the application's navigation. In our `tm` project, this is set up in `src/react-app/main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { RouterProvider, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

// Register the router instance for type safety
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}
```

### Route Definitions & File-Based Routing

We use file-based routing. The file structure in `src/routes` determines the URL paths.

- `routes/index.tsx` -> `/`
- `routes/about.tsx` -> `/about`
- `routes/tasks/$taskId.tsx` -> `/tasks/123`

### Layouts

Layouts allow us to share UI (like a sidebar or header) across multiple routes.

In our project, we use:

- `_auth.tsx`: Layout for login/signup pages (no sidebar).
- `_protected.tsx`: Layout for the dashboard (includes Sidebar, Header).

The `_` prefix creates a **pathless layout route**, meaning it wraps child routes without adding a segment to the URL.

### Route Tree Generation

TanStack Router automatically generates a `routeTree.gen.ts` file based on your file structure. You don't need to manually maintain a list of routes!

```ts
// routeTree.gen.ts (Auto-generated)
import { Route as rootRoute } from "./routes/__root";
import { Route as IndexImport } from "./routes/index";
// ...
```

In the next section, we will put this into practice with an exercise.
