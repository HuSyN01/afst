End-to-End (E2E) testing involves testing your application's workflow from beginning to end. It replicates real user scenarios so that the system can be validated for integration and data integrity.

## Why E2E Testing?

While unit and integration tests check individual parts of your application, E2E tests ensure that all these parts work together as expected in a real browser environment.

- **User Flows**: Verify critical paths like "Sign Up -> Create Task -> Logout".
- **Cross-Browser**: Ensure your app works on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Visual Regression**: Catch unintended visual changes.

## Tooling: Playwright

We recommend **Playwright** for E2E testing. It's fast, reliable, and supports all modern browsers.

### Installation

```bash
bun create playwright
```

### Writing Your First Test

Here is an example of a Playwright test that checks if the homepage loads and has the correct title.

```typescript
// tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("has title", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:5173/");

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Task Manager/);
});

test("login flow", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:5173/login");

  // Fill in the login form
  await page.getByLabel("Email").fill("user@example.com");
  await page.getByLabel("Password").fill("password123");

  // Click the sign in button
  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Sign In" }).click();

  // Expects to be redirected to the dashboard
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/dashboard/);
});
```

## Best Practices

1.  **Use Data Attributes**: Use `data-testid` for elements that are hard to select by text or role.
2.  **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be independent. Reset the database state between tests if possible.
3.  **Don't Test Everything**: E2E tests are slow. Use them for critical user flows and rely on unit/integration tests for edge cases.
