Welcome to Module 06! Now that we have built a full-stack application with a frontend, backend, database, and authentication, it is crucial to ensure that it works as expected and continues to work as we add new features. This is where **Software Testing** comes in.

## What You Will Learn

In this module, we will cover:

- **Software Testing Fundamentals**: Why we test and the different types of tests.
- **The Testing Pyramid**: Understanding Unit, Integration, and End-to-End (E2E) tests.
- **Backend Testing**: Testing Hono API handlers and middleware using **Bun Test**.
- **Frontend Testing**: Testing React components using **React Testing Library (RTL)**.

## Why Test?

Testing might seem like extra work, but it provides immense value:

1.  **Confidence**: You can deploy changes knowing you haven't broken existing functionality.
2.  **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how your code is supposed to work.
3.  **Regression Prevention**: Tests catch bugs that reappear after being fixed.
4.  **Refactoring Safety**: You can improve your code structure without changing its behavior, verified by tests.

## The Testing Pyramid

The "Testing Pyramid" is a concept that suggests how many of each type of test you should have:

- **Unit Tests** (Base): Fast, isolated, and numerous. They test individual functions or components.
- **Integration Tests** (Middle): Slower, test how parts work together (e.g., API + Database).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests** (Top): Slowest, test the entire flow from the user's perspective (e.g., clicking through the app).

In this module, we will focus primarily on **Unit** and **Component** testing.

## Tooling: Bun Test

Since we are using **Bun** as our runtime, we have access to a built-in test runner that is incredibly fast and compatible with Jest (a popular testing framework).

- **Fast**: No need to wait seconds for tests to start.
- **Compatible**: Uses familiar `describe`, `test`, `expect` syntax.
- **Built-in**: No extra packages to install for the runner itself.

Let's dive in!
