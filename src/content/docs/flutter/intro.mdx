# Introduction

Welcome to the **Flutter Development Bootcamp**! This comprehensive module is designed to take you from a complete beginner to a confident Flutter developer capable of building professional-grade applications.

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building fast, beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Unlike other frameworks that wrap web views, Flutter controls every pixel on the screen, resulting in high performance and consistency.
