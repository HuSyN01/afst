# Installation Setup

A robust development environment is key to productivity. We will set up the Flutter SDK and optimize Visual Studio Code for Flutter development.

## 1. Download Flutter SDK

Go to the [official install page](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and download the stable release for your OS.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do NOT install Flutter in folders requiring elevated permissions (like `C:\Program Files` on Windows). Use `C:\src\flutter` or `~/development/flutter`.

## 2. Update Path

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS / Linux">
    Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
    
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_DIRECTORY]/bin"
    ```
    
    Run `source ~/.zshrc` to refresh.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    1. Type **"env"** in Start Menu and select **Edit the system environment variables**.
    2. Click **Environment Variables**.
    3. Under **User variables**, find `Path` and click **Edit**.
    4. Click **New** and add the full path to `flutter\bin`.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 3. Verify with Flutter Doctor

Run the following command to diagnose your setup:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Fix any issues marked with [x] by following the output instructions (usually involves accepting Android licenses or installing Xcode/Android Studio).

## 4. IDE Configuration (VS Code)

We recommend **VS Code** for its lightweight nature and powerful extensions.

### Essential Extensions
Install these from the marketplace:

1.  **Flutter** (by Dart Code): The core extension. Debugging, Refactoring, Hot Reload.
2.  **Dart** (by Dart Code): Syntax highlighting and type verification.
3.  **Pubspec Assist**: Easily add dependencies without opening `pubspec.yaml`.
4.  **Error Lens**: See errors inline in your code editor.
5.  **Bloc**: (Optional) For easy boilerplate generation if using Bloc.

### Recommended Settings
Add these to your VS Code `settings.json` for a better experience:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true
  },
  "dart.previewFlutterUiGuides": true,
  "dart.flutterSdkPath": "/path/to/your/flutter/sdk"
}
```

## 5. Create Your First App

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`) and run:

```bash
flutter create my_first_app
cd my_first_app
code .
```

Press **F5** to run the app on your connected device or emulator.
