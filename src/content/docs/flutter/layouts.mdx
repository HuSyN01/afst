# Building Layouts

Professional apps must look good on all screen sizes. Flutter provides a powerful layout system based on nesting widgets.

## The Layout Rule
**"Constraints go down. Sizes go up. Parent sets position."**
- A parent passes "constraints" (min/max width/height) to its child.
- The child asks to be a specific size within those constraints.
- The parent positions the child.

## Core Layout Widgets

### Row & Column
These are "Flex" widgets.
- **MainAxisAlignment**: How children are aligned along the main axis (Horizontal for Row, Vertical for Column).
- **CrossAxisAlignment**: How children are aligned along the cross axis.

```dart
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Vertically centered
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch, // Stretch horizontally
  children: [
    Text("Header"),
    Expanded(child: Container(color: Colors.red)), // Fills remaining space
  ],
)
```

### Stack & Positioned
For overlapping elements (like a badge on an icon).

```dart
Stack(
  alignment: Alignment.center,
  children: [
    const Icon(Icons.shopping_cart, size: 50),
    Positioned(
      right: 0,
      top: 0,
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.red,
        child: const Text('2'),
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Safe Area
Wrap your main content in a `SafeArea` to avoid system intrusions (notch, home indicator).

```dart
Scaffold(
  body: SafeArea(
    child: MyContent(),
  ),
)
```

## Performance Tips

> [!WARNING]
> Do NOT use `Container()` just for padding or width.

-   Use **Padding** widget for padding.
-   Use **SizedBox** for fixed width/height (it's cheaper than Container).

```dart
// GOOD
SizedBox(height: 10)

// BAD (Heavier)
Container(height: 10)
```
