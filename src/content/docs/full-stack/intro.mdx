Welcome to Module 05! In this module, we will bridge the gap between your frontend and backend, turning separate pieces into a cohesive full-stack application. We'll also tackle one of the most critical aspects of web development: authentication.

## What You Will Learn

In this module, we will cover:

- **Server State Management**: Why we need TanStack Query instead of just `useEffect` and `useState`.
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Connecting your React frontend to your Hono backend.
- **CORS**: Understanding and configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Authentication**: Implementing secure user registration and login with Better Auth.
- **Protected Routes**: Securing your frontend routes so only authenticated users can access them.

## Why This Matters

A full-stack application is more than just a frontend talking to a backend. It requires robust data synchronization, error handling, and security.

- **TanStack Query** handles the complexities of fetching, caching, and updating server data, giving your users a snappy experience.
- **Authentication** ensures that users can only access their own data, a requirement for almost any real-world application.
- **Integration** is where the magic happens—seeing your React forms create real records in your database is a satisfying milestone!

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TanStack Query, TanStack Router
- **Backend**: Hono (Cloudflare Workers)
- **Auth**: Better Auth
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM (SQLite)

Let's get started by understanding how to manage server state effectively!
