import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Congratulations on making it to the final module of the course! You've built a robust API with Hono, a dynamic frontend with React and TanStack Router, and integrated a database with Drizzle ORM. Now, it's time to share your work with the world.

In this module, we will focus on taking your local development environment and moving it to a production-ready infrastructure using Cloudflare's edge network.

## What You Will Learn

In this module, you will:

- **Set up a Cloudflare account** and configure the Wrangler CLI.
- **Provision a production database** using Cloudflare D1.
- **Manage environment variables** and secrets for production security.
- **Deploy your full-stack application** to Cloudflare Workers.
- **Debug common production issues** using real-time logs.
- **Finalize your Capstone Project** with unique features and polish.

## Why This Matters

Building an application is only half the battle. Deployment is where your code meets real users.

- **Accessibility**: A deployed app can be accessed by anyone, anywhere.
- **Reliability**: Production environments are designed to be stable and always available.
- **Performance**: Deploying to the "edge" means your code runs on servers close to your users, reducing latency.
- **Portfolio**: A live URL is much more impressive to potential employers or clients than a GitHub repository link.
