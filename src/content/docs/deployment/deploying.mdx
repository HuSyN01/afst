Now that our infrastructure is ready, we can deploy the application. This involves building the frontend, configuring secrets, and pushing the code to Cloudflare.

## Environment Variables & Secrets

In development, we used a `.env` file for secrets like `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. In production, we cannot simply upload this file for security reasons. Instead, we use **Wrangler Secrets**.

<Steps>

1.  **Set the Auth Secret**

    Generate a secure random string for your production auth secret (you can use `openssl rand -hex 32` or a password generator).

    ```bash
    bunx wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
    ```

    Paste your secret value when prompted.

2.  **Set Other Secrets**

    If your application uses other secrets (e.g., `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` for OAuth), set them in the same way:

    ```bash
    bunx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
    bunx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
    ```

    > **Note:** Non-secret environment variables (like public API URLs) can be added to the `[vars]` section of `wrangler.json`, but sensitive data must always use `wrangler secret put`.

</Steps>

## Building and Deploying

<Steps>

1.  **Build the Project**

    We need to compile our TypeScript backend and build our React frontend into static assets.

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

    This command typically runs `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) and `vite build`. The frontend assets will be output to `dist/client`.

2.  **Dry Run (Optional)**

    Before the real deployment, you can check if everything looks correct.

    ```bash
    bun run check
    ```

    This runs a build and a dry-run deployment, showing you what _would_ be uploaded.

3.  **Deploy to Production**

    Finally, push your application to the edge!

    ```bash
    bunx wrangler deploy
    ```

    Wrangler will upload your worker code and your static assets. Once finished, it will print your deployed URL:

    `https://tm.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`

</Steps>

## Custom Domains (Optional)

If you own a domain name, you can connect it to your Worker.

1.  Go to the Cloudflare Dashboard.
2.  Navigate to **Workers & Pages** > Select your `tm` worker.
3.  Go to **Triggers** > **Custom Domains**.
4.  Click **Add Custom Domain** and enter your domain (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`).

Cloudflare will automatically handle the DNS records and SSL certificates for you.

## Verifying the Deployment

Open your deployed URL in a browser.

- You should see your React application load.
- Try signing up and logging in.
- Create a task.

If everything works, congratulations! You have a live full-stack application. 🎉
