This is the final stretch! The Capstone Workshop is designed to give you dedicated time to integrate everything you've learned and make the Task Manager project your own.

## Workshop Goals

1.  **Integration**: Ensure all parts of the stack (Frontend, Backend, Database, Auth) work seamlessly together.
2.  **Uniqueness**: Add at least one major feature that wasn't in the base tutorial.
3.  **Polish**: Improve the UI/UX and fix bugs.
4.  **Deployment**: Have a live, working URL to share.

## Feature Ideas

Looking for inspiration? Here are some features you could add to make your project stand out:

### 🌟 Beginner

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Use Tailwind's dark mode to let users switch themes.
- **Task Priorities**: Add a "High", "Medium", "Low" priority field to tasks and color-code them.
- **Due Dates**: Add a date picker to the task form and sort tasks by deadline.

### 🚀 Intermediate

- **Task Categories/Tags**: Allow users to create tags (e.g., "Work", "Personal") and filter tasks by them.
- **User Profile**: A page where users can update their name or password.
- **Drag and Drop**: Implement drag-and-drop reordering for tasks (e.g., Kanban board style).

### 🔥 Advanced

- **Email Notifications**: Send an email when a task is due (using Cloudflare Email Routing or a service like Resend).
- **Team Collaboration**: Allow users to invite others to a "Workspace" and share tasks.
- **File Attachments**: Allow users to upload images or documents to a task (using Cloudflare R2).

## Final Polish Checklist

Before you call it "done", check these items:

- [x] **Responsive Design**: Does it look good on mobile?
- [x] **Loading States**: Do you show spinners or skeletons while data is fetching?
- [x] **Error Handling**: Do you show friendly error messages if an API call fails?
- [x] **Empty States**: What does the dashboard look like when a user has 0 tasks?
- [x] **Favicon & Title**: Did you update the page title and icon?

## Submission & Showcase

Once you are ready:

1.  Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub.
2.  Ensure your latest version is deployed to Cloudflare.
3.  Update your `README.md` with:
    - A link to the live demo.
    - A list of features you added.
    - Screenshots of the application.

Good luck! We can't wait to see what you build.
