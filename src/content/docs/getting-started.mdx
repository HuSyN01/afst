Hello! We welcome you to the Course: Advanced Full Stack Development & Software Testing TOT.

This advanced training program is designed to help you create full-stack applications. You'll start by establishing your environment and building a backend foundation using **Hono.js**. The program then shifts to the frontend, where you'll master Modern **React** Fundamentals and implement type-safe routing. We dive deep into API development and adding data persistence by integrating the serverless Cloudflare D1 SQL database. We then focus on connecting the React client to the Hono backend and securing the application with user registration and login.

Finally, we dedicate the last part of the course to professionalizing your skills by mastering Software Testing, deploying your full application to the Cloud, and concluding with a Capstone Project Workshop and Final Showcase.
