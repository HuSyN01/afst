To create a simple Hello World API using Hono.js, follow these steps:

Run the following command to create a new Hono project

```bash
bun create hono@latest
```

When prompted choose the following options:

```
✔ Target directory: my-app
✔ Which template do you want to use? bun
✔ Do you want to install project dependencies? Yes
✔ Which package manager do you want to use? bun
```

This will set up a basic Hono.js project with a Hello World API.

## Project Structure

<FileTree>

- src
  - **index.ts** API endpoint is hiding here 👀
- .gitignore
- README.md
- bun.lock
- package.json
- tsconfig.json

</FileTree>

## Running the Application

<Steps>
1. Change directory to your project
    ```bash
    cd my-app
    ```

2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

</Steps>

Your app will run at `http://localhost:8787`.

Open it in your browser, and you will see `Hello Hono!`
